    <p>Configuration to define a GraphQL schema.</p>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>

    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Name<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
      <dd> provide a name to this schema definition.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Schema<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
      <dd>a graphql schema definition. Note: syntax highlighting is supported if ace extension for graphql is installed.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3>Extras - GraphQL Visual Editor</h3>
   <p>GraphQL Visual Editor build is bundled with the node. It is a visual editor for GraphQL schemas. Read more about it at <a href="https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-editor">https://github.com/graphql-editor/graphql-editor</a></p>
    <p>In order to use it you need to add a property in user settings file and restart Node-RED .
    example:
    <pre>
  {
    graphqlSchema: {
      editor: true
    }
  }
      </pre>
   </p>
   <p>Note: when GraphQL Visual editor is enabled, an editor icon will show up above the schema to launch the current schema editor in a new window. </p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
      <p>a GraphQL schema is the core of GraphQL specifications and by defining it here you can use it with any "graphql-in" node. The schema will be validated on deploy and errors will be printed to the console.
        To ensure you have a valid schema, you can use the handy Visual Schema editor to create a new schema from scratch or
        edit the currently selected schema. Once done, copy the schema definition from the Visual Editor and paste it in the form.
