    <p>Creates a GraphQL server endpoint at the defined path supporting both query and mutation operations. The endpoint serves both <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code> requests by default.</p>
    <p>
      Outputs an object <code>msg.graphql</code> with information holding the GraphQL query and the expected return type. The fulfilment of request is delegated to the flow and a response is returned using the "graphql out" node.
    </p>

    <h3>Inputs</h3>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Path<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
      <dd> a path to use for serving GraphQL queries. Make sure you choose a unique path that is not currently defined on any other http In nodes.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Method<span class="property-type">select</span></dt>
      <dd> one of the supported methods. GET and POST, GET only , or POST only. Note: GraphiQL can only be used if GET/POST is selected. A small browse icon will appear to open Graphi in a new browser window </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>GraphiQL <span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
      <dd> enables or disables the built-in GraphQL query explorer (Graphi). Graphi interface will be available at the chosen path. The default is enabled. </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Schema <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
      <dd> GraphQL schema to use for this server. choose an existing schema or configure a new GraphQL schema definition.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Resolvers<span class="property-type">select</span></dt>
      <dd>
       Choose one of the supported field resolver modes.

        <ul>
          <li><code>root operations only</code> - this option indicates that the flow will return a complete response to all root operations.
            This indicates that no additional field-level resolvers are needed in order to return a complete response to any request.
            This is a simple mode and works only if query nesting is either not expected from client requests or somehow the flow resolves nested queries without needing additional field resolvers.
            It is an error if any field requested in the client request returns an <code>undefined</code> response.</li>
          <li><code>root + all non scalar fields</code> - this option indicates that the flow provides additional field-level resolvers for all the non-scalar fields of the schema (that is: Enum, Array, Interface, Union and Object types).
            Scalar types in GraphQL specifications are Boolean, Float, ID, Int and String.
            In this mode, the complete response <code>payload</code> will combine returns from all field-level resolvers in addition to the root operation resolvers
            before sending the result to the client. The parent query result is available in the property <code>graphql.parent</code>.
            This is a typical mode for a full GraphQL server implementation in order to allow full flexiblity and support of any levels of request query nesting.
            To determine which field is requested to resolve the flow should use <code>graphql.fieldPath</code>. </li>
          <li><code>root + selected fields</code> - this option enables the user to individually select any additional field-level resolvers provided in the flow.
            This option allows you to select any type of field. Note: this option is available only after the initial node deploy.</li>
        </ul>

      </dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Timeout<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
      <dd> timeout in milliseconds for the flow to fulfill requests and return a response to client. In case of a timeout, a "Request Timeout" error message will be returned to client.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl class="message-properties">
      <dt>Use <a href="https://github.com/graphql/dataloader">Dataloader</a> to batch requests.<span class="property-type">boolean</span></dt>
      <dd>  DataLoader is a library which batches requests specifically for JavaScript. It solves the N+1 issue inherent to any GraphQL server implementation. The library reduces the overall number of datastore queries required when fulfilling requests. Instead of the server expecting each field resolver to return a value, the library allows batching of similar requests and requesting the result for the whole batch in one call. This is relevant to serving nested queries and is used to batch <code>parent</code> return data and therefore with this option <code>parent</code> data will always be an <code>Array</code>. When using this option ensure that returned results is an <code>Array</code> with the same length as the <code>parent</code> array length. If this option is not used, the node immediately sends a message to resolve every object returned by the parent query which is inefficient and should always be avoided.

  <h3>Extras - GraphQL Voyager</h3>
   <p>GraphQL Voyager build is bundled with the node. It is a nice graphical read-only explorer of GraphQL schemas. Read more about it at <a href="https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager">https://github.com/APIs-guru/graphql-voyager</a></p>
    <p>In order to use it you need to add a property in user settings file and restart Node-RED .
    example: <div style=\"padding-left:5px;\">graphqlIn: {<div style=\"padding-left:15px\">voyager: true<br>}</div></div>
   </p>
   <p>Note: when GraphQL Voyager is enabled, a button will show up next to the switch to launch the Voyager in a new window.</p>
  <h3>Details</h3>
        <p>The default resolver mode option is <code>root operations only</code>. For any given GraphQL schema, there must be at least a single root operation.
        Root operations refer to any field belonging to the 3 GraphQL operation types (query, mutation or subscription), that is those fields of any type showing under the special <code>schema</code> fragment in the schema.</p>
        <p>In this mode, it is the responsbility of the flow to return a complete response for every type of request regardless of how deeply nested the requested fields are!
          This is not often what you would need to do in a production system to take full advantage of GraphQL’s graph traversal features.
       Read More about GraghQL and schema definition at the official website <a href="https://graphql.org/">https://graphql.org/</a>.</p>
      <p><code>msg.graphql</code> contains a parsed object of the client request query in addition to the expected return type from the flow. It contains all details required to service the request.</p>
        <p>The end point is mounted on Node-Red httpNode and inherits all defined middlewares.
        This means that authorisation for this graphql server can be configured using any supported httpNode strategy. In addition, a simple GraphQL extension is added which returns the time it took in milliseconds for request to be fulfilled with every return to client.
        You can also enable SSL or any other availble option for httpNode. Check Node-RED docs for futher details and examples of auth strategies.</p>
      <p><strong>Important: </strong> this node must be paired with a "graphql-out" node to send a response back to the client.</p>
