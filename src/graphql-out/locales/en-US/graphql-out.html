<script type="text/x-red" data-help-name="graphql-out">

   <p>Sends responses back for requests recieved from a GraphQL In node.</p>

   <h3>Inputs</h3>
   <dl class="message-properties">
     <dt>output<span class="property-type">string</span></dt>
     <dd> the field containing the response payload.</dd>
   </dl>
   <dl class="message-properties">
     <dt>Return Format<span class="property-type">select</span></dt>
     <dd>
      simple formatting to change the format of <code>payload</code> before returning a response . Usually you don not need to change the format.

       <ul>
         <li><code>No Change</code> - this option is the default. No changes are made to <code>payload</code> and returns response as is.</li>
         <li><code>JSON String</code> - returns the response <code>payload</code> as a JSON String.</li>
         <li><code>JSON Object</code> - returns the response <code>payload</code> as a parsed JSON Object.</li>

       </ul>

     </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl class="message-properties">
     <dt>Return Type<span class="property-type">select</span></dt>
     <dd>
      change the <code>payload</code> to and from an array before returning a response. This is just a shortcut rather than using multiple nodes because in many situations, it is a needed operation.
      Use other nodes before sending a response if you intend to make a number of transformations.

       <ul>
         <li><code>As Is</code> - this option is the default. No change is done to <code>payload</code> and returns response as is.</li>
         <li><code>Array Index</code> - returns an object from the <code>payload</code> array by using an index. Index defaults to 0 which is the first object of the array. <code>payload</code> must already be an array for this to work.</li>
         <li><code>Array</code> - returns the response <code>payload</code> as an array. It attempts to return the object as an array.</li>

       </ul>

     </dd>
   </dl>
     <dl class="message-properties">
     <dt>Array Index<span class="property-type">number</span></dt>
     <dd>
      if Array Index is selected for return, you must specifiy the index number to return. It defaults to index 0 which is the first item in the array.
     </dd>
   </dl>
  <h3>Outputs</h3>
                  <dl class="message-properties">
                      <dt>payload <span class="property-type">object</span></dt>
                      <dd> the completed response to send back to the response. Note: GraphQL handles query traversal and sends response back to the client on completion of all tree traversals. </dd>

                  </dl>

   <h3>Details</h3>
       <p>This node must be paired with a GraphQL In node.</p>
